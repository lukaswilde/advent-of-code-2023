# Advent of Code 2023

Here you can find my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles from 2022. I do not focus on speed but rather on 
general and readable solutions using Rust ü¶Ä.


## Usage

To run the solutions, make sure you have Rust installed. The solutions are organized as a workspace, so to run the program for e.g. `day 2`, use

```zsh
cargo run --release --bin day2 -- -i day2/puzzle.txt
```

Alternativly, the programs are configured to also accept the problem text directly. For this, use

```zsh
cargo run --release --bin day2 -- "Here is the problem text"
```

You can also build all solutions using 

```zsh
cargo build --release
```

And run the executable like above:

```zsh
./target/release/day2 -i day02/puzzle.txt
```
